                    <p>A seasoned C-suite technology leader with extensive experience in managing large-scale technology transformations and product management. Currently, I serve as the Chief Technology Officer at Conduent, a global leader in digital interactions and business process outsourcing.

Played dual roles of CTO and CIO, overseeing technology products build, client implementations, and overall client-side IT services.</p>
                    <p>My expertise spans across several key areas:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Digital Transformation:</strong> Leading the shift from transactional systems to digital platforms.</li>
                        <li><strong>AI/ML Integration:</strong> Embedding AI and ML into core products to enhance functionality and value.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cloud Native Product Engineering:</strong> Transitioning from lift-and-shift to cloud-native architectures.</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Before joining Conduent, I held senior leadership roles at Capgemini, Infosys, and HCL, managing P&Ls of up to $1 billion. From my 17+ years in Technology Consulting, I have significant experience leading enterprise transformations across ERP, CRM, BI, HR, and EAI for clients in various industries. My core strength lies in aligning technology investments to drive revenue growth, improve profitability, and enhance quality for client retention.</p>
                    <p>Aligning technology investments to revenue growth, improve profitability and at same time improve quality for client retention has been my strengths throughout my career at Consulting companies pre Conduent and last 7 years at Conduent. Transformation technology for any industry into a revenue & growth, and stock market valuation amidst change management culture is my core strength.</p>

                <div class="tab-content">
                    <h3>Evolution for Enterprises from AI to GenAI</h3>
                    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized the way enterprises operate, driving efficiencies and innovations across various industries. The advent of Generative AI (GenAI) marks a significant advancement over traditional AI, leveraging large language models (LLMs) and the extensive computational power available on the cloud. This blog explores the evolution from AI to GenAI, differences between the two, and strategic steps for companies to adopt GenAI wisely.</p>
                    <p><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI):</strong><br>
                    AI encompasses a broad range of technologies that enable machines to mimic human intelligence. Traditional AI includes machine learning (ML) models that are trained to perform specific tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and predictive analytics. AI models improve over time through data exposure, learning patterns, and making data-driven decisions.</p>
                    <p><strong>Generative AI (GenAI):</strong><br>
                    GenAI, a subset of AI, uses LLMs to generate human-like text, images, and other content. Unlike traditional AI, which focuses on recognizing patterns and making predictions, GenAI can create new content by understanding context and semantics. GenAI models, such as GPT-3 by OpenAI, leverage massive datasets and powerful cloud computing resources to produce sophisticated outputs.</p>
                    <h4>Differences between AI and GenAI</h4>

                <div id="tab-3" class="tab-content">
                    <h3>The Evolution from AI to GenAI</h3>
                    <p><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI):</strong></p>
                    <p>AI encompasses a broad range of technologies that enable machines to mimic human intelligence. Traditional AI includes machine learning (ML) models that are trained to perform specific tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and predictive analytics. AI models improve over time through data exposure, learning patterns, and making data-driven decisions.</p>

                    <p><strong>Generative AI (GenAI):</strong></p>
                    <p>GenAI, a subset of AI, uses LLMs to generate human-like text, images, and other content. Unlike traditional AI, which focuses on recognizing patterns and making predictions, GenAI can create new content by understanding context and semantics. GenAI models, such as GPT-3 by OpenAI, leverage massive datasets and powerful cloud computing resources to produce sophisticated outputs.</p>

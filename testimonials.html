            <blockquote>
                <p>"Rahul is an exceptional and dynamic leader who combines deep technical knowledge with a strategic mindset. His unflagging support of his teams, combined with his ability to quickly course correct an extremely large troubled product and technology delivery organization, makes him a true asset to any organization needing to transform and lead their product strategy and delivery services." - Anna Thwaits, Professional Services Delivery Executive at Capgemini, Oracle, KPIT</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"Rahul is an exceptional Leader with whom I had the pleasure of working closely as his HR Business Partner between 2014-2017. His leadership and strategic vision have been instrumental in driving BU's success. He consistently demonstrated a deep understanding of business needs and effectively aligned HR strategies to support our goals. His ability to foster a collaborative and inclusive work environment significantly boosted team morale and productivity. Beyond his professional acumen, Rahul is a compassionate leader who genuinely cares about his teamâ€™s well-being and development. His mentorship and guidance have been invaluable to many, including myself. His dedication, expertise, and people-centric approach make him an asset to any organization & I would love to work with him again in future." - Prarthana Mitra, HR Business Partner - Lead at Capgemini</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"I have known Rahul for a while as my client and a senior leader in the industry. Rahul is truly exceptional. A thought leader with great business & Technology acumen and a leader who can drive great outcomes. I have learned a lot from him, enjoyed doing business with him. He will be a tremendous asset to any team." - Angan Guha, MD & CEO @ Birlasoft</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"My association with Rahul goes back almost 9 years now, and his leadership style is unique. Empowering his team, letting them take the bold steps, and then standing behind them like a pillar, are his core ethos. His ability to understand customer's pain points, clarity of the vendor/OEM ecosystem, connects across the industry - be it BFSI, Retail, Manufacturing, and above all, the simple approach to any business scenario using the 'KISS' model ('Keep it a Simple Solution'), makes working with him a pleasure. He drives his team to have a view on 'equity value' of their own thereby inculcating a healthy competition within. He can keep the vendor and customer ecosystem in good books and deliver with great results, based on his strong interpersonal abilities. He has orchestrated some un-imaginable deals, constructs in past - be it taking over a large BFSI event from a leading IPP, to signing multi-year deals at the booth of a conference, and continues to build solutions that are focused on addressing pain points commonly seen in the industry. Truly an asset and a great leader. Above all, a great Friend. Best wishes always!" - Harshawardhan Laghate, Consulting | Enterprise Solutions | Business Risk Management</p>
